# QR Code Scanner

This is a QR code scanner app that I developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML and CSS were employed for structure and styling, respectively, while JavaScript was utilized to add functionality to the code.

The JavaScript concepts incorporated into the app include:

- Functions
- API fetch function
- Promises
- 'then' method
- if-else statements
- Event Listeners
